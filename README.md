## How to install on your PC?

##### prerequisites
- [x] NodeJS installed on your PC
- [x] Internet connection on your PC

First make sure you have NodeJS installed on your PC and your PC has internet connection (*because we are using MongoDB Atlas, I mean we are using MongoDB on the cloud, so you need internet connection to connect to this cloud Database*). Then clone the repo. Open it on your favourite Text Editor (mine is VS Code). Then, run this command on your terminal to install all the dependencies...
  
```npm install```


Then run this command...

```npm start``` or ```node app.js```

It will start your local server. Wait until you see these logged on your terminal

``
  Server is running on port 5000
``
``
  connected to MongoDB 
``


Now open your favorite browser (mine is Chrome) and then go to **localhost:5000**. You will see the App runnig live on your PC. Now enjoy playing with the codebase!
